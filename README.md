# HighwayAgents
Highway Agents is the PHP Project where the contractor who lays the roads in the city or remote areas can hire the people locally without worrying about the workers.

This in turn helps in two ways
1.Providing the Employment oppurtunities to local.
2.No need to worry about the workers hiring somewhere and paying them extra.

In this application i have integrated with the Google maps where the contractor can search for the employees at that particular location.
